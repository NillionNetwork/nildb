nilDB is a structured data persistence service, which when multiple nodes are combined into a cluster, offers a robust, distributed and queryable data persistence solution. Paired with the nilQL library ([nilql-py](https://github.com/nillionnetwork/nilql-py) or [nilq-ts](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/nilql-ts)), users can leverage advanced cryptography to enable homomorphic operations, secret sharing, and other secure data processing use cases.
